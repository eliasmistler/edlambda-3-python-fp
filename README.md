# EdLambda #3: Functional Programming in Python
Materials for a talk I gave on 2021-07-22 at [EdLambda #3](https://www.meetup.com/EdLambda/events/278423103/)

## Excerpt
Python is a powerful and pragmatic multi-paradigm language. While it has a bias towards object orientation, thinking in an FP mindset can be very beneficial to your data work. So how to bring the two together?

This talk aims to show how thinking in a functional mindset can improve your Python code, particularly if you work in an exploratory environment such as Jupyter.

We will look at the conceptual side and potential benefits, as well as some practical examples using Pandas and the toolz library.

## Run the notebook
